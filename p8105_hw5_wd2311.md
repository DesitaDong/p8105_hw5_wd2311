# Problem 1

## Define birthday-checking function

``` r
bday_sim = function(n_room) {
  birthdays = sample(1:365, n_room, replace = TRUE)
repeated_bday = length(unique(birthdays)) < n_room
repeated_bday
}

bday_sim(20)
```

    ## [1] FALSE

## 10000 simulation runs

``` r
bday_sim_results = 
  expand_grid(
    bdays = 2:50,
    iter = 1:10000
  ) |> 
  mutate(
    result = map_lgl(bdays, bday_sim)
  ) |> 
  group_by(bdays) |> 
  summarize(
    prob_repeat = mean(result)
  )
```

## Plot the function

``` r
bday_sim_results |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = bdays, y = prob_repeat)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line() +
  labs(
    x = "Group Size", 
    y = "Probability",
    title = "Probability of Sharing Birthday for Increasing Group Size"
  )
```

The probability is very small for small groups, but it rises quickly as
group size increases. Around 23 people, the probability is already about
0.5—there’s roughly a 50% chance that at least two people share a
birthday.By about 40–50 people, the probability is above 90%,
approaching 1 as the group grows. This is the classic birthday paradox.
Even though there are 365 possible birthdays, we don’t need anything
close to 365 people before a match becomes very likely. The curve’s
steep, nonlinear rise shows how quickly shared birthdays become almost
guaranteed as the group size increases.
